A grid cam, short for grid camera, is a type of imaging system used for various applications that require high precision and accuracy. Here are the key points about grid cams:

What is a Grid Cam?
A grid cam is an imaging device that captures images through a grid or an array of sensors. It is typically used in scientific, industrial, and medical applications where detailed and precise imaging is required.

How Does a Grid Cam Work?
Sensor Array: The core component of a grid cam is the array of sensors arranged in a grid pattern. Each sensor in the grid captures a portion of the overall image.

Image Acquisition: When an object or scene is imaged, each sensor in the grid captures data for its specific area. The data from all sensors are then combined to create a high-resolution, detailed image.

Data Processing: The captured data often undergoes processing to enhance the image quality, correct distortions, and extract relevant information. Advanced algorithms may be used to stitch the images from different sensors seamlessly.
